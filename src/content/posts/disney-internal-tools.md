Disney Create was a portal on disney.com that allowed children to post drawings and other creative work.
Because of [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa),
as well as Disney's intensive focus on protecting children,
content moderation was a critical focus of our company.

For various reasons, the content moderation needed to keep detailed reports of how much time was spent moderating each IP.
Moderators tended to shift focus throughout the day,
which made it fairly difficult for them to track their work manually.

Since their moderation tools were entirely in the browser,
I proposed building a chrome extension that would infer which IP they were moderating,
and would track their time silently in the background.

I asked my managers to allow me to build it, and they agreed.
I officially transitioned to a junior developer role,
and built out the extension alongside the moderation team,
collecting feedback and iterating on the feature set.

I called the extension Mod Minutes, and I'm still proud of it to this day.
I could easily see the result of my work as the team reported back how much time it saved them.
If I hadn't taken that initiative, I wouldn't have landed my next role.

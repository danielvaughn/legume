I'm a Floridian software engineer who has been building web applications for over a decade,
mostly in startups across a variety of industries.
I'm fullstack, but lean about 70% frontend.

Much of my personal work revolves around designer/developer collaboration.
I've been building a suite of tools for this purpose,
including a domain-specific programming language for designers,
and a keyboard-driven UI design tool.

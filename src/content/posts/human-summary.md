My time at HUMAN Security, formerly called WhiteOps, is one of my favorite work experiences.
It was founded by hackers, [one of whom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky) was a [DNS keyholder](https://www.ces.tech/articles/2020/october/the-truth-about-the-people-with-the-keys-to-the-in.aspx).
HUMAN is a mission-driven organization that is trying to rid the world of malicious bot activity.

I worked on their dashboard team,
which offered custom BI intelligence tools for their customers.
My role there was as initially as a fullstack web engineer, then later on as engineering manager over the team.

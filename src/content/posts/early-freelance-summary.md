While I was learning how to become a developer, I took on a couple of freelance projects.

One was for a photographer in Pennsylvania, the website is called [Studio Luminoso](https://studioluminoso.photography/).
The current website is not the one I created in 2012.

The other freelance project was for a church called [The Assemblies of Yahweh](https://assembliesofyahweh.com/).
As of 2024, they are still using the same site I built in 2012.

Both sites were built on Wordpress, from scratch using a custom theme.

The church website required some custom javascript as they used the site for live broadcasts of their services.
I worked with a backend engineer to stream live video from an endpoint for their remote members.

While I was learning how to code, I took on a couple of freelance projects.
They were built on Wordpress, from scratch using a custom theme.
I was the sole designer and developer for both sites.

1. A portfolio website for a photography studio in Philadelphia, called [Studio Luminoso](https://studioluminoso.photography/). The current website is not the one I created in 2012.

2. A website for a church called [The Assemblies of Yahweh](https://assembliesofyahweh.com/). As of 2024, they are still using the same site I built in 2012. This site required some custom javascript as it was used for live broadcasts of their services. I worked with a backend engineer to stream live video from an endpoint for their remote members.

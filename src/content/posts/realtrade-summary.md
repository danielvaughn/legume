In late 2020, [HUMAN Security](/u/danielvaughn/j/sfe_hsi) was [acquired by Goldman Sachs](https://www.humansecurity.com/newsroom/white-ops-announces-acquisition-by-goldman-sachs-merchant-banking-clearsky-security-and-nightdragon).
By stroke of luck, I had just finished my vesting schedule with them.
This afforded me a unique opportunity to take a sabbatical.

Around the same time, I was working out of a co-working space in Palm Beach FL called [1909](https://www.weare1909.org).
There I met Ryan Poole, a real estate agent who was building a proptech company called RealTrade.
After developing a close friendship with him, he convinced me to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.

As founding engineer,
I led the development of the entire RealTrade platform,
alongside a talented junior engineer from Venezuela.

I learned a great deal about the business side of software.
I'm ashamed to admit that I had some naive misconceptions about how my own industry worked,
as well as how difficult it can be to obtain funding.
I spent weeks and months working with Ryan to hone our landing page copy, our business model, and our pitch deck.
In the end, we weren't able to convince investors, and it became infeasible for me to continue on without a pay check.

I'm still very happy that I took the risk, as it taught me many invaluable lessons.
Today, Ryan continues working on RealTrade, and I continue advising him on technical matters as a vested partner.

I worked for Disney in Boulder, Colorado.
Disney had acquired a startup called Kerpoof,
which was a creativity application designed for children ages 4-7.

After being acquired by Disney,
they were tasked with building out a similar application directly on Disney.com.
I initially joined their content moderation team in 2010,
ensuring the safety of their young users on both Kerpoof and this new product (called Disney Create).

During this time I was teaching myself how to code,
and eventually convinced them to let me manage our QA efforts across both products.
I worked closely with engineers to test new features,
and also led QA when we released 2 mobile apps for Disney.

By 2013 I had gained enough trust and confidence with my bosses that I convinced them to let me transition to a junior developer role.
I had noticed a feature gap on the team and wanted to address it.

## Mod Minutes

The content moderation team had a significant focus on the time spent moderating each product.
This time tracking was used for tax purposes as well as product initiatives - during some campaigns they were asked to spend more time moderating specific IPs.
The problem was that the moderators tended to shift focus throughout the day,
which made it fairly difficult for them to manually track how much time they were spending on each IP.

Since their work was entirely in the browser,
I proposed a chrome extension that would allow them to easily update the current IP they were moderating,
and would track their time silently in the background.

My managers agreed, and I officially transitioned to a junior developer role.
I built out the extension alongside the moderation team,
collecting feedback from them as I built out the feature set.

I called the extension Mod Minutes, and I'm still proud of it to this day.
I could easily see the result of my work as the team reported back how much easier it made their work.
If I hadn't taken that initiative, that wouldn't have happened, and I wouldn't have landed my next role.

Because of this work,
one of the moderators let me know that their boyfriend had just taken a job at a startup called Kapitall in New York City,
and offered to introduce me to him.
I had dinner with him one night and we hit it off - his name is Antonio Reyes.
As he was going to be lead developer at Kapitall, he offered me to fly out and interview for a junior role they had just opened.
I took that job in March of 2014, and I've been working as a software engineer ever since.

Antonio and I are still good friends, and he was a groomsman at my wedding a few years ago.

What I learned from this experience is that you miss every shot you don't take.
I am naturally shy, and had very little confidence in my own abilities as an engineer at this point in my life,
because I'd never tried them out "in the real world."
It was _nerve wracking_ to suggest to my manager to create a new role for myself,
but looking back I'm so glad I took the risk.

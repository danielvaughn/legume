In 2009, Disney acquired a Colorado-based startup called [Kerpoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerpoof).
It was a suite of creativity games aimed at children ages 3-7,
and Disney used their technology to build a similar application on disney.com.
This new product was called Disney Create, and was the focus of my work.

I joined them in 2010, initially as a member of the content moderation team.

During this period, I was teaching myself how to code,
and eventually convinced them to let me manage our QA efforts across all products.
I worked closely with engineers to test new features,
and also led QA when we released 2 mobile apps for Disney.

By 2013 I had gained enough trust and confidence with leadership that I convinced them to let me transition to a junior developer role,
where I remained until early 2014.

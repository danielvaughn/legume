In the leadup to our first deployment,
we discussed security at length.
We came to the conclusion that any breach was unacceptable,
regardless of material impact.
This is because NextEra is a national corporate entity with significant government contracts,
making it an extremely risk-averse company.

I took the initiative to create a reusable security checklist,
intended to be the backbone for quarterly security audits.

It involved a very wide array of checks across our entire system in GCP,
including everything from closing open ports to reducing least privilege of our service accounts.

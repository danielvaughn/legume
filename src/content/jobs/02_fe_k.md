Kapitall was my first time being hired as an in-house software developer.

Their app was the product of the Web 2.0 era - it was a "drag and drop stock trading" application.
The idea was to appeal to younger millennials, making it effectively Robinhood-before-Robinhood.

I worked on both the frontend and backend.
The frontend was fairly old by that time,
having been written around 2008 or so.
It was built with a completely custom framework, as was typical of that era.

tech:

- worked on the frontend, custom framework
- built a web-based mobile game using cordova
- built their landing page
- worked on their backend (java/groovy/sql)

personal:

- learned what it looks like for a company to fail
- learned that strong leadership it make-or-break for companies
- learned that if what you're doing isn't working, revisit your core assumptions and start from first principles
- learned that you should speak up and get involved if you have ideas, no matter your role

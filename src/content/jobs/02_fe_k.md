Kapitall was my first time being hired as an in-house software developer.
At the time, I had been writing JavaScript for a few years,
but mostly for scripting.
This was my first exposure to a full-blown framework.
The team had written a completely custom framework, as was typical of that era.

Their app was the product of the Web 2.0 era - it was a "drag and drop stock trading" application.
The idea was to appeal to younger millennials, making it effectively Robinhood-before-Robinhood.

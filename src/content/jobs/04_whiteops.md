HUMAN Security, formerly called "WhiteOps," is a very cool company.
It was founded by hackers (actual hackers),
and [one of the founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky) was a [DNS keyholder](https://www.ces.tech/articles/2020/october/the-truth-about-the-people-with-the-keys-to-the-in.aspx).
Their mission is to rid the world of malicious bot activity by making it prohibitively expensive for anyone but
(a) state actors, and (b) international crime rings.
They do this by collecting an insane number of data points on network transactions,
and using machine learning to suss out not only bot markers but also human markers.
If you want to bypass their detection systems, you better set aside _tens of millions_ of dollars for operating costs.

We offered custom BI intelligence tools for our customers,
what was dubbed "The WhiteOps Dashboard."
My role there was as primarily as a fullstack web engineer, working on that product.
It remains one of my favorite work experiences,
not only for the uniquness of the work itself,
but also because of the close relationships I developed with my coworkers.

tech:

- built dashboard frontend and backend
- initially was using Angular 1.6 and foundation
- used nodejs and mongo on the backend
- also talked to druid, worked with data engineers to get queries down to 1-3s for all customer queries. 6pb database!
- used D3 for visualizations
- migrated to react while I was there
- I built a microframework for using react in place of D3
- migrated from rest to graphql

learned:

- our job is not to write code, but to solve business problems
- lines of code are spent, not written
- engineering management is not a "step up" from senior, it's an entirely different profession
- keeping the company culture as you grow is very hard, and may not even be possible
- success is not binary; even winning can involve losing
- migrating frameworks is incredibly expensive, choose your tech stack wisely!

HUMAN Security, formerly called "WhiteOps," is a very cool company.
It was founded by hackers (actual hackers),
and [one of the founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky) was a [DNS keyholder](https://www.ces.tech/articles/2020/october/the-truth-about-the-people-with-the-keys-to-the-in.aspx).
Their mission is to rid the world of malicious bot activity by making it prohibitively expensive for anyone but
(a) state actors, and (b) international crime rings.
They do this by collecting an insane number of data points on network transactions,
and using machine learning to suss out not only bot markers but also human markers.
If you want to bypass their detection systems, you better set aside _tens of millions_ of dollars for operating costs.

We offered custom BI intelligence tools for our customers,
what was dubbed "The WhiteOps Dashboard."
My role there was as primarily as a fullstack web engineer, working on that product.
It remains one of my favorite work experiences,
not only for the uniquness of the work itself,
but also because of the close relationships I developed with my coworkers.

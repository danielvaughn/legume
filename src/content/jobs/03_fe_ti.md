I consider TradeIt to be my "baptism by fire."
I had been writing code for several years by that point,
and had 2 professional years under my belt.
But I was self taught, and I'd only briefly ventured beyond the front end.

At that point, I had done some server-side work with PHP in Wordpress,
and had spent a little over a year writing Java/Groovy endpoints for Kapitall.

TradeIt, on the other hand, had me reverse-engineering mobile APIs and building native SDKs in Objective-C.

This role was being developer #2 for an early stage startup,
so to say it was a change of pace was an understatement.
I remember going months without taking a single day off.

While it was a stressful experience, I don't regret it for a moment.
And while I don't think that crunching that hard is healthy,
I'm glad that I was able to find out what I was capable of.

tech:

- built their landing page
- built an embeddable script for opening a trading widget directly on client pages
- reverse engineered mobile APIs for nearly all retail stock brokerages (etrade/fidelity/robinhood/etc)
- built an iOS sdk for embedded a trading widget onto client apps
- built an iOS app for trendline analysis

personal:

- learned how important communication was
- learned that burnout is real and is something to be avoided
- learned that there's such a thing as a healthy work/life balance

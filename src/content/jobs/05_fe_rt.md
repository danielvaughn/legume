In late 2020, [HUMAN Security](/u/danielvaughn/j/sfe_hsi) was [acquired by Goldman Sachs](https://www.humansecurity.com/newsroom/white-ops-announces-acquisition-by-goldman-sachs-merchant-banking-clearsky-security-and-nightdragon).
By stroke of luck, I had just finished my vesting schedule with them.
This afforded me a unique opportunity to take a sabbatical.

Around the same time, I was working out of a co-working space in Palm Beach FL called [1909](https://www.weare1909.org).
I met Ryan Poole there, a real estate agent who was looking to build a proptech company called RealTrade.
After developing a close friendship with him, he convinced me to take the plunge,
not into sabbatical, but into entrepreneurship.

My work there involved building out the entire platform,
alongside a talented junior engineer out of Venezuela.

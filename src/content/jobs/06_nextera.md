I initially joined NextEra as a senior frontend engineer.
There was a re-org just a couple months into my tenure,
and frontend skills were no longer needed.

My manager and I discussed my situation,
and I decided to become a platform engineer.
I had always ignored DevOps,
preferring instead to build products directly.
As a result, my DevOps skills were lacking.
By exposing myself to something new, I knew I would gain some useful experience.

After over a year of being on the platform team,
I came to realize that I don't prefer DevOps long term.
To gain true senior-level proficiency in that domain would be a multi-year effort for me,
and would require me to reduce the amount of time I spend building programs.

I'm glad I did it, if only for having discovered Terraform.
I _love_ Terraform.
I also love helping other engineers,
and I've developed a strong passion for building developer tools.

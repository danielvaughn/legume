I initially joined NextEra as a senior frontend engineer.
After a couple of months in the role,
there was a re-org,
and we discovered that we no longer needed frontend skills.

My manager and I discussed the situation,
and I decided that I wanted to transition to the platform team.
I had always ignored DevOps,
preferring instead to work on product engineering.
My knowledge was therefore lacking in this area,
so I wanted to give my skillset some breadth by exposing myself to something new.

After over a year of being on the platform team,
I've come to realize that I don't prefer it long term.
To gain true senior-level proficiency in that domain would be a multi-year effort for me,
and would require me to reduce the amount of time I spend building programs.

I'm glad I did it, if only for having discovered Terraform.

I _love_ Terraform.

I also love helping other engineers,
and I've developed a strong passion for building developer tools.

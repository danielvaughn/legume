    Online resumes suck:
    <ul class="pl-1 negatives">
      <li>
        Writing and maintaining them are a pain, and LinkedIn doesn't really
        help.
      </li>
      <li>It's not clear what to include in them or how to format them.</li>
      <li>
        They don't capture your <i>story</i> - you are more than a list of bullet
        points!
      </li>
    </ul>

      Legumé offers a fully interactive resume that lets you tell your story in
      as much depth as you want. It basically turns your resume into a website.
      Afterwards, you can easily generate and maintain abbreviated PDFs that are
      custom-tailored to highlight a different aspect of your work history.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3 text-pretty">
      This means you
      <b>write your resume once</b>, and we take care of the rest.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 text-lg font-bold tracking-wide">Pricing</h2>
    <p class="text-pretty">
      You can sign up for free, write and host your resume, and generate a PDF.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-pretty">
      If you want to tailor multiple PDF versions, and if you want to be
      included in a list of resumes that we provide to recruiters, we kindly ask
      for $3/month billed annually.
